Greetings!

This repository contains the implementation of a "Face Recognition App" that uses Clarifai API to detect faces in pictures that user provides in application.

Frontend was built with React.js, backend with Express.js and for database I used PostgreSQL.

Instructions to set the app up:

git clone https://github.com/tonikutlesa/FaceRecognitionApp.git
Position yourself inside the FaceRecognitionApp directory
cd server
npm install
cd..
cd client
npm install


Steps to run the app (position yourself inside the FaceRecognition directory):

cd server
npm start
Open up new terminal
cd client
Add your own database credentials to server.js line 12
npm start
Enjoy!

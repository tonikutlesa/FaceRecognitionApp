Greetings!

This repository contains the implementation of a "Face Recognition App" that uses Clarifai API to detect faces in pictures that user provides in application.

Frontend was built with React.js, backend with Express.js and for database I used PostgreSQL.

Instructions to set the app up:

1. git clone https://github.com/tonikutlesa/FaceRecognitionApp.git
2. Position yourself inside the FaceRecognitionApp directory
3. cd server
4. npm install
5. cd..
6. cd client
7. npm install

Steps to run the app (position yourself inside the NewsPortal directory):

1. cd server
2. npm start
3. Open up new terminal
4. cd client
5. npm start

Enjoy!
